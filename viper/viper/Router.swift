import Foundation

// VIPER assumes there will be different Modules in my application
// Router will be able to route within it's own module
// Consider if my app has 5 tabs... each tab it's potentially a  module

// It DOES NOT have a reference to anything else
// It is the ENTRY POINT for my module. This is where the VIPER architecture starts
// This is the entrance to our ViewController
